# TranslatorBot-Telegram-Bot
This bot (@translate_mess_bot) can translate into 3 different languages your messages in Telegram app.
Firstly, you need to sign up in Google Cloud, connect and download Google Translate API and only after this you can use my code.
Also you need to get Translator API key (.json format) and then instead <path of transltorApi .json key file> write path to this key file.
If you don't know how to create bot in Telegram app, you should to send /help to @BotFather in Telegram app.
Thanks for using my code!
