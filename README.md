# TranslatorBot-Telegram-Bot
This bot (@translate_mess_bot) can translate into 3 different languages your messages in Telegram app.

Firstly, you need to sign up in Google Cloud, connect and download Google Translate API and only after this you can use my code.

Also you need to get Translator API key (.json format) and then instead <path of transltorApi .json key file> write path to this key file.
